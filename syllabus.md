# 🧭 6-Month Roadmap: Data-Oriented Full Stack Engineer

**Goal:** Transition from Senior Data Analyst to Data-Oriented Full Stack Engineer — capable of building complete data applications (ETL → API → Frontend → Deployment).

**Time Commitment:** ~8–10 hours per week  
**Prerequisites:** Strong Python, SQL, and analytical background

---

## 📅 Month 1 — Solidify Software Foundations

**🎯 Goal:** Write clean, modular, testable Python and understand backend app building blocks.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- Python for production:
  - Modular structure (`__init__.py`, config files)
  - Logging, error handling, CLI arguments
  - Use of `argparse`, `logging`, `pathlib`, `dotenv`
- Version Control / GitHub Workflow:
  - Branching, pull requests, `.gitignore`, GitHub Actions intro
- Databases refresher:
  - PostgreSQL or SQLite setup
  - SQLAlchemy ORM basics

### 🧩 Project: *Mini ETL Framework*
- Build a Python module that:
  - Reads CSV or API data
  - Cleans/transforms it
  - Loads it into Postgres
- Add tests (`pytest`), logging, and documentation.

✅ **Deliverable:**  
GitHub repo named `etl_framework/` showing professional code organization and testing.

---

## 📅 Month 2 — Backend APIs with FastAPI

**🎯 Goal:** Build production-style APIs that expose data to other apps.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- FastAPI Fundamentals:
  - Endpoints, routers, dependency injection
  - Query/body params, Pydantic models
  - Async I/O basics
- Database integration:
  - Connect FastAPI to Postgres with SQLAlchemy
  - CRUD operations and schema validation
- Containerization:
  - Intro to Docker: images, containers, networking

### 🧩 Project: *Data Access API*
- Wrap your ETL output in a FastAPI app
- Endpoints: `/data/latest`, `/stats`, `/health`
- Run in Docker, document with Swagger UI

✅ **Deliverable:**  
Deployed FastAPI API (local or on Render).

---

## 📅 Month 3 — Frontend for Data Apps

**🎯 Goal:** Add a front end to visualize and interact with your data.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
Choose a front-end path:
- **Option A (fastest):** Streamlit or Plotly Dash (Python-based)
- **Option B (professional):** React (JSX, components, hooks, fetch)

Topics:
- APIs → Frontend integration
- Displaying charts, tables, and metrics
- Handling API requests and state

### 🧩 Project: *Interactive Analytics App*
- Create a dashboard (e.g., marketing campaign performance)
- Front end calls FastAPI endpoints
- Use Plotly or Recharts for visualizations

✅ **Deliverable:**  
Interactive web app + API backend.

---

## 📅 Month 4 — Orchestration & Automation

**🎯 Goal:** Turn your app into a system that runs automatically.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- Workflow orchestration (Prefect or Airflow)
  - Tasks, flows, retries, logging
  - Scheduling and dependencies
- Environment Variables (`.env`, secrets)
- Cloud Storage (optional): AWS S3 basics

### 🧩 Project: *Automated ETL with Scheduler*
- Rebuild ETL to run nightly via Prefect
- Write logs to table or file
- Add email/Slack notifications on failure

✅ **Deliverable:**  
A scheduled, monitored ETL pipeline feeding your app.

---

## 📅 Month 5 — Deployment & DevOps

**🎯 Goal:** Deploy and manage your app like a professional engineer.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
  - Linting, testing, automated deploys
- Docker Compose:
  - Bundle app + DB + frontend
- Cloud Deployment:
  - Render, Railway, or AWS ECS/Fargate
- Monitoring:
  - Health endpoints, basic Grafana or uptime tracking

### 🧩 Project: *Production Deployment*
- Deploy entire stack (API + frontend + DB)
- Add health monitoring and logging

✅ **Deliverable:**  
Live URL running your full-stack app.

---

## 📅 Month 6 — Scale, Optimize, and Polish Portfolio

**🎯 Goal:** Demonstrate readiness for data-platform or full-stack engineering roles.

### 🧠 Learning Focus
- Performance Optimization:
  - Polars, Dask, async queries
- Packaging:
  - Create installable Python packages
- Documentation & Portfolio:
  - Write `README.md`, architecture diagrams, and a project write-up

### 🧩 Capstone Project: *Data Platform MVP*
Combine all prior work into one production-style product:
- Automated ETL → Database → API → Dashboard → Cloud Deployment

✅ **Deliverable:**  
Public GitHub repo + live demo app.  
Include write-up: *“From Data Analyst to Full Stack Engineer: How I Built a Data Platform from Scratch.”*

---

## 📘 Optional Deep Dives
If you finish ahead of schedule:
- Learn **dbt** for SQL-based transformations
- Add **FastAPI authentication** (OAuth2/JWT)
- Experiment with **GraphQL** (Strawberry / Ariadne)
- Explore **Terraform** or **Pulumi** for Infrastructure as Code
