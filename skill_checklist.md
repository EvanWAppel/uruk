# 🧱 1. Programming Foundations (Python-Focused)

## Core Python Skills

### ✅ Functions, modules, imports, and packages

### ✅ Classes and object-oriented design

### 🔲 Decorators, generators, list/dict comprehensions

### ✅ Exception handling and custom exceptions

### ✅ File handling (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)

### 🔲 Logging and debugging (logging module, traceback)

### ✅ Type hinting (typing module, mypy)

#### 🧠 What is `mypy` and How Is It Used?

##### Overview
**`mypy`** is a **static type checker** for Python.  
It checks your code *without running it* to make sure your **type hints** make sense and match how the code is used.

It was created by Jukka Lehtosalo (and now maintained by Dropbox & the community) to bring **compile-time type safety**—like you get in Java, TypeScript, or C#—to Python’s dynamic world.

---

##### ⚙️ How It Works
Python itself doesn’t enforce types — these are *hints* (PEP 484).  
`mypy` analyzes your code and warns when your hints and usage don’t line up.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

result = add(2, "three")
```

Python will run that just fine (and crash at runtime 😅),
but mypy will catch it before execution:
``` python
error: Argument 2 to "add" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
```
##### Usage
``` bash
pip install mypy
mypy my_project/
mypy example.py

```

### 🔲 Command-line interfaces (argparse, click, or typer)

Allows you to write python functions that accept arguments in the CLI

#### argparse

```python
# example_argparse.py
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Example with argparse")
parser.add_argument("name", help="Your name")
parser.add_argument("--count", type=int, default=1, help="How many greetings")

args = parser.parse_args()

for _ in range(args.count):
    print(f"Hello, {args.name}!")
```
