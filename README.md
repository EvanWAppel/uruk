Personal website for Evan Appel.

## What Was Built
- Crafted a professional landing page (`index.html`) that introduces me as a coder, writer, and humorist with sections highlighting engineering work, writing, humor, and ways to connect.
- Added a blog homepage (`blog.html`) that showcases featured posts and includes a newsletter-style subscribe form.
- Designed shared styling (`styles.css`) covering layout, typography, cards, and responsive behaviour so the site feels cohesive across pages.
- Linked social profiles (X, LinkedIn, GitHub) and contact email to make it easy for visitors to reach out.
